# Colors

Primary colors are RGB, White, and Black

RGB is the first you get via crystals

Blood topaz is red crystal

Prasiolite is green crystal

Adventurine is blue crystal

Void quartz is black

White doesn't really have a crystal (or if it does, it's just plain nether quartz)


Red represents destruction, and passion

Green represents inaction, and indifference

Blue represents preservation, loyalty, creation, and wisdom

White represents light itself, unity, harmony, purity

Black represents the raw power of magic, and emptiness

These colors are too pure of concepts to be used on their own, so they usually have to be mixed.

Each mix between 2 RGB primaries has 3 shades.

Red blue mixes:

Rose (#ff007f) - 4 red 2 blue

Rose represents Creativity. The burning passion of red with the direction and wisdom of blue leads to creativity

Magenta (#ff00ff) - 3 red 3 blue

Magenta represents CYCLES and TIME. It's the balance of destruction and creation, a cycle. In the real world cycles
happen all the time, with history rhyming. Maybe you'll make the same mistakes as those before, maybe not.
Used to make some redstone timing components

Purple (#8000ff) - 2 red 4 blue

Purple represents GROWTH and PROGRESS. It improves things. To improve things we must break a few things,
but ultimately we make things better. Purple can be used to accelerate growth of plants.

Red green mixes:

Orange (#ff8000) - 4 red 2 green

Orange represents DISASTER. The destruction of red destroys all, and the green lets it happen. This can
be used to make powerful weapons.

Yellow (#ffff00) - 3 red 3 green

Yellow represents EROSION. It wears things down, but it's somewhat controlled. Can be used to make block
breakers. 

Lime (#7fff00) - 2 red 4 green

Lime represents REGRESSION. The inaction of green washes out the destruction of red, but destruction still works.
Could be used to make primitive resources that are no longer available.

Green blue mixes:

Seafoam (#00ff7f) - 4 green 2 blue

Seafoam represents REFLECTION. Wisdom of blue makes one think, but green makes one do nothing. This can be used
to observe the world and perform calculations.

Cyan (#00ffff) - 3 green 3 blue

Cyan represents STASIS. Preservation of blue combined with the inaction of green makes things unchanging.
Can be used to prevent mob griefing and explosions in a radius. Can be used to make containers too,
because it keeps your items unchanging and safe : )

Azure (#0080ff) - 2 green 4 blue

Azure represents OBEDIENCE. Blue's loyalty is corrupted by the inaction of green, removing the wisdom of blue.
This can be used to make hostile mobs ignore the player, or maybe even make them do your will (with a little
black magic, of course)
