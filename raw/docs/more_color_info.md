I feel like there should be more materials for some more important colors.

Some ideas I had:

Cyan:

Stillwood & Stillwood Bark

I really like idea of having bark stripped from logs.

I like vanilla blocks and don't like having to make new blocks, so I considered
using warped wood because that's also just cyan, but I think I prefer if
it was in the overworld (or maybe via some other mechanism like 
botania's livingwood).

It should defo still have a sapling, even if it uses a different mechanism to make
(or it should be at least more tolerable to make on demand than livingwood)
